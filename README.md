- [ ] **Storage:** Some storage scheme. Key value store?

- [ ] **Redundancy:** Store the table when program finishes.

- [ ] **Data Types:** Some data types.

- [ ] **Schemas:** Compulsory singular primary keys, unique and foreign key constraints, indexes.

- [ ] **Transactions:** ?

- [ ] **Query Engine:** Query execution engine. Optimize.

## Thoughts

Can the REPL be a function `f: DB -> DB`, in the spirit of Functional Core, Imperative Shell, Ã  la Gary Bernhardt?

Basic REPL in place.
